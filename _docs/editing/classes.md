Our template includes styling for a range of classes by default. You can apply these to elements in markdown.

## Formatting

Use these classes in your markdown to create specific formatting effects.

| Epigraph source               | `.epigraph-source`                     | Block           | The person to whom the epigraph is attributed. To apply this class, place `{:.epigraph-source}` dircetly under the source of the epigraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No                      |

| Figure                        | `.figure`                              | Block           | A figure is an image with a caption.

| Figure: fixed position        | `.fixed`                               | Block           | Add to the `.figure` tag, e.g. `{:.figure .fixed}`. For figures that must keep their position in the text flow, and must not float to the top of the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No                      |
| Figure: large                 | `.large`                               | Block           | Add to the `.figure` tag, e.g. `{:.figure .large}`.  This restricts the maximum height of the image to a large height. Note that the `.large` class makes the figure fixed. By default,  figures automatically reflow, so this prevents the large figure from appearing at the end of the page, which larger figures tend to do.                                                                                             | No                      |

This restricts the maximum height of the image to a medium height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | No                      |
| Figure: small                 | `.small`                               | Block           | Add to the `.figure` tag, e.g. `{:.figure .small}`. This restricts the maximum height of the image to a small height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No                      |
| Figure height                 | `.height-1` to `.height-50`            | Block           | Sets the height of an element to a multiple of the default line height. Use in figures, on line after image, add it to the figure tag like this `{:.figure .height-12}` for an image whose height should be 12 lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes                     |
| First paragraph               | `.first`                               | Block           | For any paragraph that starts a new set of paragraphs, which should be flush left and with a gap above it. Add `{:.first}` immediately below this first paragraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | No                      |

| Float to bottom               | `.float-bottom`                        | Block           | Floats the element to the bottom of its page. Useful for boxes. Applies to print output only. Apply `{:.float-bottom}` under the element which you'd like to float to the top.

Apply `{:.keep-together}` to the end of the entire element. You can also apply it to a span (e.g. a phrase, like `<span class="keep-together">24/7</span>`) to prevent it breaking over a line.                                                                                                                       | Yes                     |

Apply the class to the parent element, for example place `{:.allow-break}` directly below the entire list.                                                                                                                                                        | No                      |

Can be added to the first block element on a page by using `{:.page-1}` after the first element, or to the YAML header, in addition to the main style, e.g. `style: halftitle-page page-1` or `style: chapter page-1`.

| Small caps (lowercase only)   | `.smallcaps`                           | Block or inline | Works if your font supports proper small-caps glyphs. Only affects the lowercase letters.

## Reserved classes

You may also need to create your own classes for other uses. If you do, avoid using the same already-supported class names above. You should also avoid using the following ones, which are reserved for specific structural elements.

| Class name | Reserved for
|---|---
| `index` | The home page of a collection, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `cover` | A front cover, which will appear in ebook editions, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `halftitle-page` | A book's halftitle page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `previous-publications-page` | A book's list of the author's previous publications, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `title-page` | A book's title page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `copyright-page` | copyright or imprint page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `contents-page`  | A book's table of contents, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `dedication-page` | A dedication page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `epigraph-page` | An epigraph page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontispiece-page` | A frontispiece page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontmatter` | For other prelim pages not accounted for otherwise, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `chapter`  | A book's default chapter page (and the global default), used for the `style` value in file YAML headers

## The edition suffix

If you want to produce more than one print edition of a book from the same source file, you can't use the same classes that affect text-flow – like `.tighten-1`, for instance – in both editions, because the text will flow differently in each edition.

Our workflow has a way to manage that. In the print CSS file, you can specify an edition suffix. For instance, if you're producing a schools edition of a book, you might make your suffix `-schools-edn`. That suffix will be appended to the end of certain class names for that stylesheet. The default `.tighten-1` class will become `.tighten-1-schools-edn` in your final print CSS.

(It's a good idea to start a suffix with a hyphen and use all lowercase letters, to keep your output CSS neat. Never use spaces.)

Only some classes are affected – see the table above for which ones. The most important are the classes used for tightening and loosening letter-spacing, which are mostly used to control widows and orphans in print layout.

In your markdown, then, you'd use `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn}` instead of `{:.tighten-1}`, and that class will then only have an effect on your schools edition. If you had another edition, say a large-print edition with a `-large-print` suffix, you'd use a `{:.tighten-1-large-print}` tag in the markdown. These would match the classes automatically generated in each edition's CSS.

Of course, one element can carry both classes. For instance, you might end up with a paragraph tagged with `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn .tighten-1-large-print}`. That paragraph would then be tightened in both print layouts.

## Deprecated classes

Early versions of the EBW used the following classes, which are no longer supported:

* `shrink`
* `tighten`, `tight`, `x-tight`, `xx-tight`, `xxx-tight`
* `loosen`, `loose`, `x-loose`
