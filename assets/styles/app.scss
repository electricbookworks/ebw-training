# Project CSS for app output
---

// This CSS is mainly for use on the project home-page,
// used in web and app outputs. (Others don't have a home page.)
// In older projects, we fetched the home-page CSS from
// the first book in _meta.yml. But sometimes that book
// is excluded from the build, or has idiosyncratic styles.
// This Sass file is project-wide CSS for non-book pages.

// Set variables specific to the project here
// that override the defaults in _sass/app.scss


// Import master styles
@import 'app';


// -------------
// Custom styles
// -------------

// Add any custom Sass or CSS here.
