    description: |
      An in-depth, practical crash course in ebook production, ideal for editorial and production staff familiar with InDesign. 
      The aim is to provide your organisation with in-house technical expertise for quality assurance and production-process decisions. 
      We teach basic HTML and CSS (stylesheets) to enable participants to create, evaluate and fix basic epubs, 
      and to know how to tackle problems when they arise. Participants work mostly in Sigil and a little InDesign, 
      learning how best to edit content and control layout. 
      This course includes condensed versions of *Starting out with HTML and CSS* and *InDesign best practice for print and ebooks*.

    description: |
      A two-day course for publishing and editorial staff, and curious authors, on how to edit content for multi-format output. 
      Increasingly, we're producing content that will be read on paper and on devices large and small, fast and slow, 
      online and offline. How do we make sure our content makes sense in these different contexts?

    description: >
      ‘Digital decisions’ is a day-long course for publishing staff. 
      We paint a picture of the digital publishing landscape, 
      and take the unfamiliarity out of key digital-publishing concepts. 
      We range from big concepts to workflow nitty-gritty.
